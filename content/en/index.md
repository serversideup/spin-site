### Use Docker the way it's intended with Docker Overrides
- Docker Overrides are an extremely powerful feature that allows you to standardize your environment. [Learn more ‚Üí](getting-started/introduction)
- Replicate 100% of production, no matter what environment you're in
### Install locally or at the project
- Install on your system with automatic updates (without requiring root permissions)
- Available via NPM
- Available via Composer
### Works with any language
- Spin is just a bash wrapper that improves the user-experience for developers
- Choose any docker image that you'd like or build your own Docker image
### Follows Docker standards
- Spin passes your commands to the official Docker commands, so there is no reason for you to learn a domain-specific language or learn another standard
