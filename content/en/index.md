## Replicate production in a single command
**Stop wasting time fixing production issues you've already solved.** Spin is a bash utility that improves the user-experience for teams using Docker. Replicate any environment on any machine, regardless if they are running MacOS, Windows, or Linux. Centralize your infrastructure from a single configuration file using Docker.

Inspired by [Chris Fidao](https://twitter.com/fideloper) and [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail), Spin aims to speed up and simplify the management of development environments -- no matter which language or operating system you're developing with.

## Improve the development experience

#### üò± Turn this:
```bash
docker compose pull --ignore-pull-failures && docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --remove-orphans
```
#### ‚ö°Ô∏è Into this:
```bash
spin up
```

### Use Docker the way it's intended with Docker Overrides
- Docker Overrides are an extremely powerful feature that allows you to standardize your environment. [Learn more ‚Üí](getting-started/introduction)
- Replicate 100% of production, no matter what environment you're in
### Install locally or at the project
- Install on your system with automatic updates (without requiring root permissions)
- Available via NPM
- Available via Composer
### Works with any language
- Spin is just a bash wrapper that improves the user-experience for developers
- Choose any docker image that you'd like or build your own Docker image
### Follows Docker standards
- Spin passes your commands to the official Docker commands, so there is no reason for you to learn a domain-specific language or learn another standard
